Early Dementia Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict early signs of dementia using certain features from the OASIS-2: Longitudinal dataset. The model is designed to classify patients as either demented or non-demented based on their data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the OASIS-2: Longitudinal dataset. The principal investigators for the dataset are:

D. Marcus
R. Buckner
J. Csernansky
J. Morris

Features Used
The following features from the dataset are used to build the model:

M/F (Gender)
MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination)
eTIV (Estimated Total Intracranial Volume)
nWBV (Normalized Whole Brain Volume)
ASF (Atlas Scaling Factor)
Group (Diagnosis label: demented or non-demented)

Project Steps
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing numerical features
Model Building:

Creating and training a machine learning model using the selected features.
The target variable is Group, which indicates whether a patient is demented or non-demented.

Evaluation:

Evaluating the model's predictions using appropriate metrics.
Assessing the model's accuracy and performance.

Results
The model was built to predict early signs of dementia and demonstrated reasonable accuracy during the evaluation phase. However, it is important to note that this model is not production-ready and should be considered a rough draft to showcase my knowledge and interest in machine learning and neuroscience.
